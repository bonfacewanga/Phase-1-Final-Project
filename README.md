# Project description
The application is a workout planning application that has a variety of exercises for all the different days of the week.
It also has a dropdown list that allows the user to select the day of the week that they are at and a calendar that  can act as a helper for keeping track of the user's progress.
The application provides a set of instrucions on how to execute the exercise correctly for optimum gain and to prevent any form of injury that may occur from engaging in the exercise in the wrong posture for example.
The application as well provides the primary equipment for that particular set of exercise.
There's also an illustration image to help guide the user.

## Monday
For Monday, the application guides the user towards engaging on some set of exercises aimed at gaining muscle for the chest. 


## Tuesday
For Tuesday the user has to follow the same drill as in Monday in channeling the commitment and following the exercise instructions set out by the application except the focus of the day is exercising the back muscles with emphasis on the lower back.

## Wednesday
For Wednesday, the drill being the exact same, the focus of the day is working the biceps muscles.

## Thursday
This day focuses more on working the triceps part of the arms.

## Friday 
Friday is different as compared to the rest of the week, this is a unique day given it's the one and only day of the week that demands the user to commmit to working the lower part of the body with emphasis on the calf muscles.

## Saturday
Saturday reverts to the upper body muscles with the focus particularly on shoulders.


## Sunday
Sunday is a unique day in itself. It's an amazing day and it involves the user engaging in a relaxing yoga session with no intensive kind of exercises.
The user is required to adhere to their meals and make sure to enjoy themselves and relax as they await the pending week and the exercises that come with it.

## Additional Functionalities
The application has buttons that listen for a click event then display an alert message as per the callback functions passed as arguments to the event listeners attached to the button(The event targets).
