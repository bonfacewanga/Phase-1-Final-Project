# Project description
The application is a workout planning application that has a variety of exercises for all the different days of the week.
It also has a dropdown list that allows the user to select the day of the week that they are at and a calendar that  can act as a helper for keeping track of the user's progress.
The application provides a set of instrucions on how to execute the exercise correctly for optimum gain and to prevent any form of injury that may occur from engaging in the exercise in the wrong posture for example.
The application as well provides the primary equipment for that particular set of exercise.
There's also an illustration image to help guide the user.
